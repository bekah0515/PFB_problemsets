Bekah by Shel Silverstein

Bekah loves me,
Bekah cares,
Bekah picks me peaches and pears.
Bekah offers me candy and Cokes,
Bekah listens and laughs at me jokes.
Bekah helps when I get in a fight,
Bekah does all my homework at night.
Bekah misses me,
Bekah cries,
Bekah thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Bekah is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Bekah just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Bekah's hand,
In the darkness where Bekah usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Bekah's gone!
